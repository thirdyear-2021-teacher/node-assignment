# Say Hello

In this assignment you'll work with outputting text to `stdout` (or Standard Out) and getting input from `stdin` (or Standard In). Try to complete the assignment, commit your changes and see if they worked!

1. In `Hello.java` change the output to be "Hello world!"

2. In `HelloName.java` ask the user for their name and then say hello to them.

Code well!

## Setup

`javac *.java`

## Run

`java -cp . [function name]`
